# usb-simcard-reader
The software extracted from the driver CD from the common blue USB simcard reader (see phoos). Since nobody owns CD drives anymore and I couldn't find this software anywhere else.

Additionally when connecting the device to a Windows 10 machine I ran into a driver problem "PL2303HXA PHASED OUT SINCE 2012. PLEASE CONTACT YOUR SUPPLIER". Which I solved by installing this driver https://github.com/brucetsao/Drivers/raw/master/FAKE_PL2303/IO-Cable_PL-2303_Drivers-Generic_Windows_PL2303_Prolific.zip as described in this article https://www.connectix.nl/pl2303hxa-phased-out-since-2012-please-contact-your-supplier-solved/.
